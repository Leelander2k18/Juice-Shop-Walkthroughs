* Challenge description: Find an accidentally deployed code sandbox for writing smart contracts on the fly * 

When first looking at the description, the first word that pops out is code. 
1. I decide to then look at the source code of the Juice Shop site through the inspect tool in the browser settings (this can be done with any type of browser). 
2. Clicking on the inspect tool, I was sent to a screen showing html code under a window titled "Elements". 
3. I clicked on the "Sources" window and clicked on the main.js file under the access/public/images folder. 
4. At this point, I'm thinking I found the source code, now I need to find the sandbox within the code. I hit Ctrl+F and search for the word "sandbox" within the code. 
Results: path: "web3-sandbox" (BINGO!) 
5. I copied the path name (just what is inside the quotes) and pasted it after the /#/ in the URL and hit enter. 
CONFETTI! WE FOUND THE FLAG!
