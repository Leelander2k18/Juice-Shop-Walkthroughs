* Challenge Description: Post some feedback in another userâ€™s name * 

NOTE: This challenge requires BurpSuite

1. The first I do for this challenge is to fire up BurpSuite and my proxy (foxy proxy is my preferred proxy for Burp). 
2. I navigated to the Customer Feedback page from the drop down menu on the shop's homepage. 
3. I put in random letters in the username and password fields before submitting. Also, give a rating. I used my proxy to forward the request to Burp where I can now investigate this further. 
4. I focused my attention on BurpSuite to look at the raw code of the request that came in, where I notice a "UserId: ". Now this is promising. 
5. All I have to do now is change the name within the UserId field before forwarding the request and we can now see that the feedback we sent is in a different username.
