* Challenge Description: Submit 10 or more customer feedbacks within 10 seconds. *

NOTE: Having BurpSuite and a proxy open would be helpful for this challenge. 

1. I made sure my proxy and burp were setup before I navigated to and filled in the customer feedback form under the Juice Shop's drop down menu.

2. I go to BurpSuite and navigate to the HTTP history under the proxy tab and locate my customer feedback submission (/api/Feedbacks). I send this onto the repeater tool. 

3. All I do now is hit send in the repeater tab super fast 10 times and the challenge is complete!
