* Challenge Description: Gain read access to an arbitrary local file on the web server *

For this challenge, using the Kali Linux VM comes in handy. 


1. Since we're trying to find any files in the application, I'm using the dirbuster tool. In my Kali terminal, I type "dirb https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com" to see what I can find.

2. While it's scanning I go back to the web application and type in "/ftp" at the end of the URL to get access to the files and internal library for the web application. 

3. Exploring the files, I notice that any time I try to open files that were not of ".pdf" or ".md", I would get an error message saying that only those two file types were allowed to be accessed.

4. The goal for this challenge is to access a file that is not allowed. I decide to do a fuzzing test on the file name of a disallowed file to see if adding random characters to the URL will in a way "confuse" the security check into letting me gain access to the file. 

5. I add characters such as % and numbers to the URL and refresh the page to find that it now allows me to view the contents of a file I had previously been denied access.
