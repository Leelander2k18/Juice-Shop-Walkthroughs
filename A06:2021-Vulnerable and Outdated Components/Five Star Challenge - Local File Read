* Challenge Description: Gain read access to an arbitrary local file on the web server *

1. I go to the Juice Shop web application and type in "/ftp" at the end of the URL to get access to the files and internal library for the web application. 

3. Exploring the files, I click on the acquisitions.md file and see the contents. However, for this challenge, I need to go deeper.

5. The goal for this challenge is to go beyond the /ftp directory and access an operating system file. Therefore, I need to perform a directory traversal.  I type in the URL (/ftp/../../../etc/passwd) to try and get access to internal juice shop configuration information. I look at the request in the Burp Suite proxy and can see the juice shop configuration information in the packet response.
