* Challenge Description: Provoke an error that is neither very gracefully nor consistently handled * 

The fun in this exercise will come from using the ffuf tool to find potential hidden directories that can cause an error message

1. Fire up the ffuf tool (I'm using the Kali VM for this). The command we will use is: ffuf -u https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/FUZZ
2. I see there is the "/ftp" directory which catches my eye, I navigate to the directory where I am sent to a page containing different files
3. I click on the first one I see called "coupons_2013.md.bak" where I am hit with an error message: "Only .md and .pdf files are allowed!" 
WE DID THE CHALLENGE!
