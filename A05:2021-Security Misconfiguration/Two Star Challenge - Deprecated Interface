* Challenge Description: Use a deprecated B2B interface that was not properly shut down * 

NOTE: When uploading files for this challenge, only zip and pdf files are allowed. You also need to be logged into an account before doing this challenge. 

1. Whenever I think of B2B, the first thing that comes to mind is you're having a back to back conversation with someone. In this case, I'd like to think we're having a "Business 2 Businesss" conversation on an error we found within their site. Hence, we want to make this known in the Complaint form found under the shop's drop down menu. 

2. I go to the Juice Shop homepage and open the developer tool settings on my browser (I'm using chrome). I search for pdf in the main.js file and see that pdf, xml, and zip files are the only filetypes allowed to be uploaded to the web application.

3. I fill out the form and upload a random existing pdf file from my computer before submitting the form and the challenge is complete!
