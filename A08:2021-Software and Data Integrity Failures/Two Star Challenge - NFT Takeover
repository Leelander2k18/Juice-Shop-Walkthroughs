* Challenge Description: Take over the wallet containing our official Soul Bound Token (NFT) * 

NOTE: BurpSuite and a proxy will be handy for this challenge. :) 


1. After setting up my BurpSuite and proxy, I acess the main.js file through the developer tools. I Ctrl+F to search for anything in the code that mentions NFT where I find the path: juicy-nft. 

2. I navigate to the juicy-nft URL path where I am taken to a page that asks for my private key to access the NFT wallet. 

3. I access the administrator account and look at at customer feedback where I find this message:"Please send me the juicy chatbot NFT in my wallet at /juicy-nft : "purpose betray marriage blame crunch monitor spin slide donate sport lift clutch" (***ereum@juice-sh.op)"

4. I copy and paste the string into a mneumonic converter which gives me te private key: 0x5bcc3e9d38baa06e7bfaab80ae5957bbe8ef059e640311d7d6d465e6bc948e3e

5. I copy and paste the private key into the NFT wwallet verification page where I am greeted with the message saying I have completed the challenge!
