* Challenge Description: Gain access to any access log file of the server * 

NOTE: Kali VM will be useful for this challenge. 


1. After booting up my Kali Linux VM, I use the ffuf tool to perform a fuzzing test on the Juice Shop application to identify any hidden endpoints. 

2. To help filter out the responses from the fuzzing test, I type in -fs 2000 (random high value for content size) at the end of my previous command. This shows a few interesting endpoints: /assets, /legal. 

3. I try more fuzzing tests with each of the endpoints where I get a hit from /legal/private. I click on the file in the hidden page, and the challenge is now complete.
