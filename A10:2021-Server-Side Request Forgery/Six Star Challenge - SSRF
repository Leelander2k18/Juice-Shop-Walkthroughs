*Challenge Description: Request a hidden resource on server through server. *


1. To start this challenge I make sure my BurpSuite and proxy are ready. After logging into my account, I go to my profile page and find the "Link to image" where I will need to enter an external image URL. 

2. I go to my terminal and make a new directory so that I can run a Python script to test for SSRF in the juice shop application. When the test works, anything the Juice Shop backend tries to fetch will show up as a request in the terminal. I enter the test server-side request URL into the "link to image" field, and it shows on the terminal after submitting. This means the web application is vulnerable to an SSRF attack. 

Challenge complete :)
