* Challenge Description: Reset Jim's password via the Forgot Password mechanism with the original answer to the security question * 

NOTE: BurpSuite and a proxy will be handy for this challenge. :) 


1. After setting up my BurpSuite and proxy, I first went to the products page and go through each product's reviews in order to find Jim's email (Jim@juice-sh.op).

2. I then went to the login portal and clicked on the "Forgot your Password" mechanism. 

3. After submitting the request, I filled out the "Forgot Password" form where I entered Jim's email. For the security question, it actually shows which one he used which in this case is "Your eldest sibling's name?". I inputted random values in the rest of the form and got the error message, "Wrong answer to security question" (Unsurprisingly). 

4. Going to my proxy in Burp, I located my POST request (/rest/user/reset-password). Based on previous classwork, I can already see that I'll have to brute-force my way into finding the Security Question answer. I send the POST request to the intruder tool.

5. Going to the intruder tool, I go to the right side of the page and click on "Clear (Payload Symbol)". I then add a payload symbol to the beginning and end of the "answer" field text. This allows us to brute-force just the answer field. 

6.
