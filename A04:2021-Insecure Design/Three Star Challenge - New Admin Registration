* Challenge Description: Register as a user with administrator privileges *


You'll want to use BurpSuite and proxy for this challenge ;) 

NOTE: Doing the Admin Section Challenge will be helpful for this challenge. 


1. After setting up Burpsuite and enabling the proxy (I use FoxyProxy) I go to the new user registration form and filled it in as a random person.
2. Fowarding this form, I see in BurpSuite the contents of the user authentication packet. 
3. Looking back at the administrator login packet, I see the administrator is listed under the "role" field, which isn't included the new user authentication packet. 
4. In BurpSuite, I add "role: administrator" to the Raw code in the Intercept tab and send it to repeater. 
5. The response in repeater is a new administrator account with the new user information I had had entered earlier.
6. There is no step here. WE DID IT!
