* Challenge Description: Give a devastating zero-star feedback to the store * 

Note: Make sure the BurpSuite proxy is turned on to intercept any requests

1. The first thing I did was go to the drop down menu on the top left of the homepage and clicked on Customer Feedback. 
2. I then make sure the proxy is up and running with my browser before clicking the submit button on the feedback (just out of curiousity). 
3. Looking at the request on Burp, I can see that it says "rating: 1". All I have to do now is change that 1 to a 0 for ⭐️ ZERO STARS ⭐️. Hitting the forward button in Burp will complete the challenge.
